# Welcome & Onboarding Flow

## Goal

The goal of this flow is to activate trial users within their first week by delivering early value. Engaged users receive a feature highlight, while inactive users get a reminder email to reduce drop-off. The flow is designed around a 5-day trial period but can be adapted to different timelines.

## Strategy

- Trigger: New signup
- Segments: Active vs inactive users
- Channels: Email
- KPIs: Activation %, Conversion %, CTR
