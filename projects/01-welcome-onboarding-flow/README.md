# Welcome & Onboarding Flow

## Goal

The goal of this flow is to activate trial users within their first week by delivering early value. Engaged users receive a feature highlight, while inactive users get a reminder email to reduce drop-off. The flow is designed around a 5-day trial period but can be adapted to different timelines.

## Strategy

- Trigger: New signup
- Segments: Active vs inactive users
- Channels: Email
- Timing: 4 touches across 5 days (adaptable to trial length)
- KPIs: Activation rate, CTR, Trial-to-Paid conversion

## Results (Hypothetical)

- 40% open rate on Welcome Email (industry avg: 25%)  
- 12% CTR on Feature Highlight (above benchmark of ~7%)  
- 8% of inactive users reactivated via Nudge Email  
- 15% increase in trial-to-paid conversion rate (vs control)

## Insights

- Early activation is the strongest driver of conversion â€” users who engaged with a key feature within 2 days were significantly more likely to upgrade.  
- Inactivity sets in quickly; a targeted nudge at Day 2 helped recover 8% of otherwise lost users.  
- A clear, time-bound upgrade offer at the end of the trial created urgency and delivered measurable lift in paid conversions.  

**Conclusion**: This flow demonstrates how structured lifecycle messaging, from activation nudges to time-bound offers, can turn short trials into long-term customers.
