# Churn Reduction Flow

## Goal

Reduce voluntary churn by re-engaging at-risk customers before cancellation. The flow aims to remind users of the value they’re getting, reinforce trust with social proof, and offer a last-chance incentive to retain them.

## Strategy

- Trigger: Low activity in last 14 days || Attempt to cancel or downgrade
- Segments: at-risk (inactive + downgrade intent) vs active (no action taken, excluded from the flow)
- Channels: Email (plus in-app if relevant)  
- Timing: 2–3 touches across the final 14 days before cancellation/renewal
- KPIs: Retention rate, CTR, “Save offer” acceptance, Reduced cancellations

## Results (Hypothetical)
In a simulated test cohort, this flow achieved the following outcomes:  

- ~18% of at-risk users re-engaged after receiving the Value Reminder  
- ~10% retention uplift among those exposed to the Success Story vs. control  
- ~22% Save Offer acceptance rate
- Overall churn reduced by ~12% across the test group

## Insights
- Timing matters: Engaged users responded best when offered the Save incentive within 24h of re-engagement, while inactive users needed longer delays (72h, 96h).
- Proof before discount: The Success Story email built credibility and softened resistance — making the Save Offer feel like added value rather than a desperate discount.
- Not all users should see offers: Reserving incentives only for high-risk users prevented revenue leakage from healthy accounts.
- Personalization increases trust: Using customer names, relevant features, and outcomes raised CTRs vs. generic reminders.

**Conclusion**: A structured churn reduction sequence can significantly cut voluntary churn by combining value reminders, social proof, and targeted save incentives, while protecting revenue by limiting discounts to truly at-risk users.
