# Email Marketing Portfolio — Wilkins M.

B2B email marketing specialist focused on lifecycle campaigns and webinar
funnels. Currently managing email for SiteGround's Spanish-speaking markets —
averaging **38% open rates** across 30+ webinar campaigns in 2025.

This portfolio demonstrates how I approach flow design: strategy, segmentation
logic, copy, and sequencing — not just template building.
