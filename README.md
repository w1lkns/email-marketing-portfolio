# üì® Email Marketing Portfolio

Welcome to my email marketing portfolio, a collection of self-initiated, strategy-driven projects created as part of my [üì® 365 Email Marketing Challenge](https://wilkinsmorales.com/365-email-marketing/).

Each folder contains a mini case study designed to showcase specific skills in:
- Email copywriting
- Lifecycle strategy
- Onboarding flows
- Newsletter design
- Tool evaluation and UX thinking

These are **speculative (spec)** projects based on realistic scenarios and NGOs to demonstrate my approach and capabilities.
